# ArduinoTheremin
 Theremin built with Arduino using an Ultrasonic sensor and I2C ToF distance sensor. </br>
Used two reference libraries for those sensors: </br>
1) https://github.com/microflo/NewPing : ultrasonic sensor (HC-SR04) </br>
2) https://github.com/pololu/vl53l0x-arduino : ToF distance sensor (VL53L0X) </br>
Sound design was performed in MAX/MSP </br>
